Bunch of cool tools written in python.

1. cuddle-fuzz - a port fuzzer meant for research purposes only.

2. nmap-CSV-exporeter - hate doing those pentests and analysing those tedious logs? How about scanning with nmap and getting the results ready in a normal CSV which you can customise?

3. randip - wanting to use nmap decoy scan but have a long list of fake IPs? there you go :)

4. NetCat Presistent Honeypot - built this one for your Hacking Defined Experts course and it became quite handy.

5. pass\_find.rb - A ruby module for Metasploit to recover passwords. Built by Shmuel Amar, a student at See-Security's Hacking Defined Experts course.
